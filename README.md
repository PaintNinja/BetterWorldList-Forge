# BetterWorldList-Forge
A failed series of attempts of porting BetterWorldList for Fabric to Forge.

I've tried different versions of Forge and Mixin, I've tried using yarn2mcp and I've tried manually porting over everything to MCP rather than yarn. In all cases the mod compiles and shows up in the mod menu but doesn't do anything.

I'm completely stumped and have no idea what to do. I give up :(
